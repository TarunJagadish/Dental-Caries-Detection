# Detection of Dental Caries using Image Processing and Transfer Learning

This repository contains the code and methodology for detecting dental caries (tooth decay) using image processing techniques and transfer learning. The project utilizes a dataset loaded from Kaggle, processed using Python, and analyzed using machine learning models.

## Project Overview

Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is a common dental issue. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect dental caries from dental X-ray images. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune pre-trained models for this specific task.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of labeled dental X-ray images, where the presence or absence of caries is annotated. The dataset is loaded using the Kaggle API.

## Key Features

- **Image Processing**: Various image processing techniques are applied to prepare the X-ray images for model training.
- **Transfer Learning**: A pre-trained model (such as VGG16, ResNet, or others) is fine-tuned for detecting dental caries.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate model performance.

## Dependencies

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Kaggle API
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to the project directory
- Install the required Python packages
- Download the dataset using Kaggle API
- Open the notebook
- Execute the cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance

## Results

The trained model achieves satisfactory accuracy in detecting dental caries. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are available within the notebook.
